# Spring AI for Kotlin Development

Spring AI is an extension of the Spring Framework that provides simplified integration of AI/ML capabilities into
Spring-based applications. It offers a consistent programming model and abstractions for working with various AI
services and models.

## Key Features:

- Easy integration with popular AI providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.)
- Unified API for different AI models and services
- Built-in support for prompt engineering and templating
- Simplified handling of embeddings and vector operations
- Seamless integration with Spring ecosystem
- Support for both synchronous and reactive programming models

## Use Cases:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text generation and completion
- Image generation
- Embeddings generation
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications
- Chatbot development

Spring AI helps developers incorporate AI capabilities into their applications while maintaining Spring's principles of
simplicity, flexibility, and productivity.
